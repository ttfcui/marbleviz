## Marble League, Visualized

Replication files for panels inside the main ML graphic, available here: *url pending*

### Repo Organization

The repo has an interactive Excel file, *ML_Master.xlsx*, which is a spreadsheet
I built to hold all the event data. It is interactive in that one of the tables
can be played with to display different data, and then I copy these "queries"
to other CSVs.

Each directory contains contents to replicate *one* panel. Most of them have:

1. Source data queried from the main spreadsheet or that I additionally recorded; 
2. The R code to make the visualization plus any intermediary data cleaning;
3. The individual PNGs if the panel needed manual arrangement. If the viz can be
mostly replicated by the code, the PNGs are not included.
